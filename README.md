# Judge Contract

A decentralized application of elections and opinion polls
Justice is a decentralized application aimed at holding fair elections without fraud on the visible and hearing of all.

I had had a lot of problems because I'm a principle in the field of Blockchain, especially Ethereum. Therefore, I decided to make the project opensource but on my own terms and rules to make a business deal with everyone who contribution in this project in the near future.

The whole idea is that governments are paying billions of dollars for elections and everyone is questioning their integrity as a result of the lack of independence of the judiciary in some countries and governments, so I decided to move my passion towards that point: Applied Justice on Blockchain network

From that point on, I prepared a plan to walk together:

- Preparation of electoral rooms where each room contains a number of numbers of voters (ID numbers)
- Connecting the voters' chambers to the voters and making sure they are affiliated with that room
- Use one of the front-end frameworks such as angular or react to complete the project
- Set up to start ICO for integrating the two systems together
